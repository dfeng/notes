# On the Spectral Bias of Neural Networks

src: [OR](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1gR2sC9FX)

The theory of [[implicit-regularisation]] is used to explain why overparameterised neural networks don't overfit even when no explicit regularisation techniques are used. One of the key points is that we're working in the overparameterised regime â€“ you have multiple interpolating solutions, but during training, neural networks tend to converge to the more simple solutions
