# Generalisation Paper

Almost all theory on generalisation has assumptions, except cross-validation
Let's be non-parametric, and realise that generalisastion == self-generalisation
Use self-generalisation as the measure of generalisation (i.e. cross-validation)

One might even argue that 

Cross-validation is best, but we don't use it anymore in DL. Not computationally tractible.
Might we be inadvertently using a crude form of cross-validation?
A weaker form of cross-validation, one that relaxes the hold-out set condition, that does something iteratively, might be a good approximation?
But that's just mini-batch SGD
