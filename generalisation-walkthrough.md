Start with the definition of nonparametric generalisation, and the "optimal" algorithm defined via an $\text{argmin}$.

## Is there are problem?

Something that I was thinking about before I fell asleep: it feels to me that, actually, due to the nonparametric nature of the setup.

In my "proof", I used an argument whereby one could simply swap out one algorithm for another depending on the dataset.
