Start with the definition of nonparametric generalisation, and the "optimal" algorithm defined via an $\text{argmin}$.

## Is there are problem?

Something that I was thinking about before I fell asleep: it feels to me that, actually, due to the nonparametric nature of the setup. So if we go back to the definition of nonparametric risk, the effective "support" of the algorithm is given by the 

In my "proof", I used an argument whereby one could simply swap out one algorithm for another depending on the dataset. However, that makes me think that the definition of an algorithm is a little too general?
