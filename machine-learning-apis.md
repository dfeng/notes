# Machine Learning APIs

src: [@chen2021did], [OR](https://openreview.net/forum?id=gFDFKC4gHL4)

Machine Learning APIs are weird. Usually we deal with APIs because they are well-defined and predictable (and oftentimes deterministic, i.e. a [pure function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function)). Ignoring the actual API scaffolding here (the request/response schema), which I assume would follow API convention, the key output of the API, the predictions from the ML model, are incredibly
