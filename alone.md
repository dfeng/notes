# Alone

via [OpenCulture](http://www.openculture.com/2015/03/andrei-tarkovskys-message-to-young-people.html)

This is Tarkovsky:^[Of Stalker, Solaris fame.]

> I don’t know… I think I’d like to say only that they should learn to be alone and try to spend as much time as possible by themselves. I think one of the faults of young people today is that they try to come together around events that are noisy, almost aggressive at times. This desire to be together in order to not feel alone is an unfortunate symptom, in my opinion. Every person needs to learn from childhood how to spend time with oneself. That doesn’t mean he should be lonely, but that he shouldn’t grow bored with himself because people who grow bored in their own company seem to me in danger, from a self-esteem point of view.

And here are some thoughts:

> ...our rapid-fire, pressure-cooker public discourse may grant us instant access to information—or misinformation—but it also encourages, nay urges, us to form hasty opinions, ignore nuance and subtleties, and participate in groupthink rather than digesting things slowly and coming to our own conclusions. It’s an environment particularly hostile to mediums like poetry, or the kinds of poetic films Tarkovsky made, which teach us the value of judgment withheld, and immerse us in the kinds of aesthetic experiences the internet and television, with their nonstop chatter, push to the margins.

While reflecting on the [[misinformation-project]], I can't help but think about how here I am focusing on the technological solution, when there are much more insidious and difficult, existential questions of tectonic shifts in society causing us to be easier targets of disinformation.
