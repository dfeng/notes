## Principles

Here are my main ideas/principles in designing this theme.

1. No vendor lock-in. The less vendor features you use, the better you'll be able to migrate. `[[Wikilink]]` is the only non-markdown feature supported by default, but nonetheless, it is recommended to use the standard markdown syntax, or if you edit with [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam), please use [Wikilink](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/wikilinks) with [Link Reference Definitions](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/features/link-reference-definitions). That give us the capability change our theme, or hosted place.
2. Use meta data instead of special characters. We should use `tags` as the document's metadata, not `#tag` in the plain text.
3. Use tags instead of categories. Minimal subfolders.

## Getting started

### For new wiki

This documentation assumes that you have a GitHub account and have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your Linux/MacOS/Windows machine.

1. If you haven't yet, browse over to the main [Foam documentation](https://foambubble.github.io/foam) to get an idea of what Foam is and how to use it.
2. Press "Use this template" button at [foam-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki](https://github.com/theowenyoung/foam-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki/generate) (that's this repository!) to fork it to your own GitHub account. If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private.
3. [Clone the repository to your local machine](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and open it in VS Code.

   _Open the repository as a folder using the `File > Open...` menu item._

4. When prompted to install recommended extensions, click **Install all** (or **Show Recommendations** if you want to review and install them one by one)
5. Delete all `.md` files you don't need, Change Site settings at `.layouts/gatsby-config.js`, change your CNAME at `.layouts/static/CNAME`, change your icon at `.layouts/static/logo.png`, commit your changes, and push to github, change your page settings at Github, make sure you set the page branch to `gh-pages`, then when github actions runed, you can visit your site.

After setting up the repository, head to [[getting-started]] to get familiar with your new knowledge base!

In the `docs` directory you can find everything you need to learn the basics of Foam.
