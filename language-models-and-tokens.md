# Language Models: Fancy Number Pattern Matching

Suppose I gave you a really, really long list of numbers (or symbols, or anything). Like, a really, really long list. And it's effectively random, from what you can tell. You're told there's a method to this madness/randomness. You see glimpses of repeated structures, kind of. But it's mostly just appears random.

It might help to think of it as numbers in base $|V|$, which is usually a pretty large number, but there's no ordering of the numbers. Perhaps that number of unique shades of a color.

How would you go about the problem of trying to make sense of the sequence, and perhaps start predicting the next element of the sequence?
