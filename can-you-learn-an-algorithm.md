# Can You Learn an Algorithm

src: [@schwarzschild2021can]

 > By training networks to solve problems iteratively, we hope to find models that encode a scalable method for solving problems rather than memorizing a mapping between input features and outputs. In short, the goal is to create recurrent architectures that are capable of learning an algorithm.

One way to think of ML as fancy curve-fitting.
