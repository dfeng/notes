How can responsive systems be established to effectively support the goals of fairness and representation in specific, deployed contexts?\n\nSo far we've seen people explore the biases inherent in word embeddings and language models; GPT-3 will inevitably fall into the purview of such scrutiny. Is there something manifestly different now, with GPT-3, that makes it a much more interesting question, since it feels as if GPT-3 is able to perform some low-level kinds of reasoning.\n\nIn the more basic models, you could easily attribute all the inherent biases to a reflection of the state of the world learnable through text.\n\nMy feeling is that this is slowly encroaching into the problem of how to equip artificial intelligence with notions of morality (I wonder if anyone has asked ethical questions---probably), though more importantly, might require you to actively force it to take a stand on certain kinds of topics.\n\n## Ideas\n\n - it seems to me that the missing link is the #reinforcement_learning type self-learning aspect. like, right now, the weights of GPT-3 are basically set. but it would be 1000x more worrying if it was talking to itself, or learning from all the interactions we are doing with it. that feedback mechanism feels like it would be the missing picture.\n\n## Resources\n\n - https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3\n - https://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2020/05#gpt-3\n - https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6Hee7w2paEzHsD6mn/collection-of-gpt-3-results\n - https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/L5JSMZQvkBAx9MD5A/to-what-extent-is-gpt-3-capable-of-reasoning\n\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\n[transformers]: transformers.md \"Transformers\"\n[fast-weights]: fast-weights.md \"Fast Weights\"\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\"","excerpt":"GPT-3 paper:  arXiv This is a 175b-parameter language model (117x larger than GPT-2).\nIt doesn't use SOTA architecture (the architecture is…","outboundReferences":[{"body":"var _excluded = [\"components\"];\n\nfunction _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutProperties(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded); var key, i; if (Object.getOwnPropertySymbols) { var sourceSymbolKeys = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(source); for (i = 0; i < sourceSymbolKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceSymbolKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(source, key)) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } } return target; }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = {}; var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source); var key, i; for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } return target; }\n\n/* @jsxRuntime classic */\n\n/* @jsx mdx */\nvar _frontmatter = {\n  \"tags\": [\"neural_networks\", \"biologically_inspired\"]\n};\nvar layoutProps = {\n  _frontmatter: _frontmatter\n};\nvar MDXLayout = \"wrapper\";\nreturn function MDXContent(_ref) {\n  var components = _ref.components,\n      props = _objectWithoutProperties(_ref, _excluded);\n\n  return mdx(MDXLayout, _extends({}, layoutProps, props, {\n    components: components,\n    mdxType: \"MDXLayout\"\n  }), mdx(\"h1\", {\n    \"id\": \"fast-weights\"\n  }, \"Fast Weights\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"src: ?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Ordinary RNN/LSTM neural networks have two kinds of memory.
