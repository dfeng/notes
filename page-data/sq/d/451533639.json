No vendor lock-in. The less vendor features you use, the better you'll be able to migrate. `[[Wikilink]]` is the only non-markdown feature supported by default, but nonetheless, it is recommended to use the standard markdown syntax, or if you edit with [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam), please use [Wikilink](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/wikilinks) with [Link Reference Definitions](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/features/link-reference-definitions). That give us the capability change our theme, or hosted place.\n2. Use meta data instead of special characters. We should use `tags` as the document's metadata, not `#tag` in the plain text.\n3. Use tags instead of categories. Minimal subfolders.\n\n## Getting started\n\n### For new wiki\n\nThis documentation assumes that you have a GitHub account and have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your Linux/MacOS/Windows machine.\n\n1.
