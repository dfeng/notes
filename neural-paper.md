# Towards a Unified Understanding of Neural Embeddings

 - it was shown in Barron that the approximation error of a 1-layer MLP (with sigmoidal activation functions) is governed by the power of the spectrum of the fourier transform of the signal â€“ higher frequency signals are more difficult to approximate
