# Perception

 - top down vs bottom up (optical illusions)
 - same data, different representations given context
 - AlphaGo's structure has parallels with system-1,2 thinking
   - the Monte Carlo tree search is system-2: has all the logic, slow, deliberate
   - however, you can't just exhaustively search the tree, so you need a neural network to have gain some intuition/heuristics about where to go in the tree, and that's system-1
 - 
 - GPT-3 â‰  system-1: heuristics are borne out of forming representations/models that are internally coherent
   - i.e. they find patterns, but they don't actually have 
   - *absurd mistakes*: 2-dimensional data, object-permanence, basically 
 - system-1,2:
   - framed mainly for the benefit of the populace, as people understand *agents*.
   - in fact, it's more categorizations of mental processes, and some are slower and more deliberate than others
 - the example of simple shapes moving around: clearly we're proscribing agency and come with all this model baggage even for such simple data
 - system-1 is what happens 95% of the time, until you hit something surprising, not coherent, at which point it triggers system-2.
 - system-2 can be thought of as an editor (filter) for system-1.
 - distinction between *doubt* and *surprise*:
   - instead of continuously predicting what is happening next, you see what happens and then make sense of it
   - the idea here is that you have your system-1 that just keeps running and continuously checking the data in a very straightforward manner. but then once something weird happens, your attention is drawn.
   - much more economical (?)
